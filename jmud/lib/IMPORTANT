The primary author (eostrom@nic.gac.edu) of jmud is no longer actively
working on the code, and if confronted with bug reports and
suggestions may become violent.  He also reacts negatively to requests
for help or documentation.

He will probably merge in bug fixes and features and such, but might
not, or might take a long time to get around to it.  If someone else
would like to take over this code, that would be Fine With Him.

The other authors, if confronted with any discussion of jmud, will
probably stare blankly at you; although they wrote some of the code,
(a) a lot of it has been ripped out, and (b) what remains isn't the
part you want to complain about.

Enjoy.
