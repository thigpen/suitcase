My advice:
  Put all the .el files in a directory ~/emacs/jmud
  Put the fragment-of-.emacs in your ~/.emacs file somewhere
  Put the world-file in ~/.jmud_worlds

You might not like all of the stuff, particularly the part about where to put
the .el files--if you choose another location, fix the references to
it in the .emacs fragment.  (There are two.)

So if you do that, then M-x j-mud-load will get the files in memory.
(If you use jmud enough, you might want to put (j-mud-load) at the end
of your .emacs)  And then C-c m will get you a connection, and 
C-u C-c m will autologin (if you set up a world file with your name
and password in it).
